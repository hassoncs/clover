## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| AI generates invalid games | Validation layer, self-correction, fallback templates |
| Performance issues with many entities | Entity pooling, LOD, physics sleeping |
| Image generation costs | Caching, rate limits, fallback to shapes |
| Complex physics scenarios | Limit joint types in MVP, curated templates |
| App store rejection | Follow guidelines, review similar apps |
