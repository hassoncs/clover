## Archived Skills

### `documentation.md.archived`

**Archived**: 2026-01-26  
**Reason**: Superseded by `slopcade-documentation.md` which provides Slopcade-specific documentation workflows  
**Replacement**: Use `.opencode/skills/slopcade-documentation.md`

The generic documentation skill was too abstract and lacked project-specific context. The slopcade-documentation skill provides:
- 3-tier documentation system (docs/, .opencode/memory/, TODAY_*.md)
- Roadmap integration workflows
- User intent parsing ("add to roadmap", "what's next")
- Temporal document lifecycle management
