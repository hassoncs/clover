    completedAt: "2026-01-24"
    
  - priority: low
    recommendation: "Archive Oracle consultation plans"

  # Remaining actions
  - priority: medium
    recommendation: "Review and prioritize human tasks (ht-001: AI Generation API, ht-002: Sheet Prompt Builder)"
    reason: "ht-001 is medium priority and blocks some editor functionality. ht-002 is low priority but documented."
    
  - priority: low
    recommendation: "Godot integration shows 100% completion - consider creating a completion log entry"
    reason: "Major milestone achieved, worth documenting in docs/shared/log/2026/"
