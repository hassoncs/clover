# ht-004: Godot Custom Font Rendering Pipeline

**Priority**: Medium  
**Source**: `godot_project/scripts/GameBridge.gd`  
**Status**: Open

## Issue
Godot currently uses default system fonts or internal assets. To achieve "App Store" polish, we need themed HUDs that use specific `.ttf` / `.otf` fonts dynamically.

## Context
The user wants better styling around HUDs (scores, lives) and "Game Over" screens. Rendering custom fonts in Godot via the bridge is currently unexplored.

## Requirements
- [ ] Research `DynamicFont` / `FontFile` (Godot 4) loading from a byte array or local file path.
- [ ] Update `GameBridge.gd` to accept font data/URLs.
- [ ] Create a utility to download/cache fonts in the app and pass them to the Godot process.
- [ ] Verify performance impact of dynamic font loading.
