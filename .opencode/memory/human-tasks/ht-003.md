# ht-003: Implement BLE Android Peripheral Bridge

**Priority**: High  
**Source**: `app/lib/networking/ble/BLEPeripheralManager.ts`  
**Status**: Open

## Issue
The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) multiplayer host functionality is currently "iOS Only". The `BLEPeripheralManager.ts` file uses a stub for all other platforms that throws a "Not implemented" error.

## Context
The user wants 2-player synced physics via BLE as a core "fun/powerful" launch feature. Without Android support, the feature is limited to half the market.

## Requirements
- [ ] Create `BLEPeripheralModule.kt` (or Java) in `app/android/`.
- [ ] Implement `BluetoothGattServer` and `BluetoothLeAdvertiser` logic.
- [ ] Map the Kotlin events (subscription, data received) to the React Native `DeviceEventEmitter`.
- [ ] Update `app/lib/networking/native/BLEPeripheralModule.ts` to link the new module.
