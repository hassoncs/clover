## Why Blocked

This task requires capabilities I don't have:

2. Making authenticated HTTP requests (need auth token)
3. Opening Godot editor GUI
4. Taking screenshots

2. Run API tests
3. Test in Godot
4. Take screenshots
5. Document results in `poc-results.md`
6. Mark Task 11 complete in plan

## Next Steps

Since this is blocked, looking for other incomplete work in the codebase.
