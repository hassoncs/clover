# Open Problems - Asset Sheets

Appended 2026-01-24

- Decide whether tile maps should reference sheets by stable numeric tile index only, or allow named tile IDs (index remains simplest for performance/editor).
- Confirm how the runtime (Godot bridge) should accept atlas regions/animations (new bridge APIs vs preprocessing into runtime resources).
