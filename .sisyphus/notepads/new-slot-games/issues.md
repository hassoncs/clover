# Issues - New Slot Games Implementation

## Known Challenges
- Grid-based games (2048, Memory, Connect4) need grid state management
- Flappy Bird needs continuous obstacle spawning
- Puyo Puyo is most complex - combines two systems

## To Watch For
- Slot registration timing - must happen before game loads
- Physics vs kinematic movement for grid games
- Input handling differences between games
